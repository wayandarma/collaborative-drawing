# PROJECT BASED LEARNING ( EXPRESS JS )

### Project Overview

A collaborative drawing app allows multiple users to draw on a shared canvas in real-time. We will use Express.js to set up the server and Socket.io for real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and the clients (browsers). The main components of the project will be the server, the client, and the communication layer.

#### Key Features:

1. **Real-time Drawing:** Users can draw on a canvas and see others' drawings in real-time.
2. **Multiple Users:** Support for multiple users drawing simultaneously.
3. **Persistence:** Optionally, save the canvas state so that new users joining the session can see the current drawing.

### Project Structure

Here's a typical project structure for our collaborative drawing app:

```
collaborative-drawing-app/
├── public/
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── styles.css
│   ├── js/
│   │   └── app.js
│   └── index.html
├── routes/
│   └── index.js
├── views/
│   └── error.ejs
├── app.js
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
└── README.md
```

### Project Structure Details

1. **`public/`**: This directory contains all the static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) served to the client.

   - **`css/`**: Contains stylesheets.
   - **`js/`**: Contains client-side JavaScript files.
   - **`index.html`**: The main HTML file served to the client.

2. **`routes/`**: This directory contains route definitions.

   - **`index.js`**: Defines the routes for the application.

3. **`views/`**: This directory contains template files for server-side rendering.

   - **`error.ejs`**: Template for rendering error pages.

4. **`app.js`**: The main entry point for the Express application. This file sets up the server, middleware, and routes.

5. **`package.json`**: Contains metadata about the project and lists dependencies.

6. **`package-lock.json`**: Automatically generated file that records the exact version of each installed package.

7. **`README.md`**: A markdown file that provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage information.

### Next Steps

1. **Set Up the Project:**

   - Initialize the project with `npm init`.
   - Install dependencies: `express`, `socket.io`, and optionally `ejs` for template rendering.

2. **Create the Server:**

   - Set up an Express server in `app.js`.
   - Serve static files from the `public` directory.
   - Initialize Socket.io on the server.

3. **Client-Side Implementation:**

   - Create a canvas in `index.html`.
   - Add event listeners in `app.js` to capture drawing events.
   - Use Socket.io to emit drawing events to the server and broadcast them to all clients.

4. **Testing and Deployment:**
   - Test the application locally.
   - Optionally, deploy the application to a cloud platform (e.g., Heroku, Vercel).
